## Instructions for Walk and capture

### Capture Setup using Kinect
Virginia Ortiz Andersson - September / 2014

Please have the following materials:

1. Microsoft Kinect 360.
2. Source Bivolt Adapter 110-220v Sensor Kinect For Xbox 360.
3. turntable.
4. Microcomputer and Software previously installed.
5. Power extension with at least 3 or 4 outlets.
6. Small table or class (60cm high, but can vary).
7. A tape measure or measuring tape
8. Adhesive tape for markings on the floor. (Can be tape + pieces of paper).
9. classroom or other place with enough empty space and electric lighting.

Setup Mounting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Check the classroom or other place for the presence of obstacles (chairs, tables, etc.) and remove them to not interfere with the walk of individuals. The room must be completely empty or partially empty for capture, as shown in Figure X.

2. Choose a wall to place the table that will support the Kinect sensor. Kinect not should "look" direct windows or other light sources. In places with windows, if possible, select the window wall for positioning the sensor.

3. Position the class or table by the wall chosen in the center of it.

4. Place the turntable on the same table. Choose a place to put the computer without interfering with the turntable. Remember that Kinect will be placed on top of this dish and it needs to stay with free view.

5. Prepare an extension cord, check outlets, and turn all equipment electronics used during capture. You can now connect the Kinect if you want. 

6. Position Kinect on the turntable, "looking" at the center of the wall opposite, with its base on or closest possible to the outer circumference dish.

7. Mark the position of the Kinect on the floor, below its initial position with the tape or tape + paper. At the end of these steps, you should present a similar setup to shown in Figure 1

Marking the limits and semicircle to walk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - now use the tape or tape measure to measure from the bottom marker
starting position of Kinect, 3m radii length, the sides, diagonals and center,
a semicircle, as shown in Figure 2. Use paper or tape to make
markers on the ground at the end of each spoke, as shown in Figure 2, obtaining the
Final installation similar to Figure 3.

walk illustrated by the arrows.

Walk and capture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Run the KinectGait.exe program and check the image that appears. Ask for
volunteer to stand in a semicircle of markers. In this step, should
up a skeleton in front of the image of the person, represented its main
joints. Verify that you can view the entire skeleton and any joint
is no trace. If necessary, close the program and run KinectGait.exe
KinectCalibration.exe to adjust the position of the Kinect sensor.

2 - With KinectGait running, move the dish on the wing and check that no
obstacles in the sensor and its field of view.

3 - See Figure 4. It shows the arrows indicating the two walking directions
an individual must perform, starting at the left side of the sensor, through the
diagonals, center, to the right side of the sensor. In this position the person should be
instructed to return, running the same path over and finalize the initial position.
Memorize this procedure to request execution to volunteers.

4 - For each new volunteer walk, perform the following steps:

	• Ask your name or provide any unique identifier for that
	individual (as Person141). Also ask your age, height and weight and
	provide your gender (male or female). Record this information together
	with its handle for later use.
	
	• In the "Capture" menu, click "New Capture ..." and provide the handle.
	Enter the number of walk (eg, "1" if the first "2" to
	second, etc.). Ok, or enter.
	
	• Ask the person to position the first marker to the left of
	Kinect.
	
	• Turn the plate and hold the person and his skeleton in the center of the screen
	which appears in the capture program. If the skeleton is not showing,
	ask for the person to position yourself facing the kinect, in the same
	position of up to 10 cm ahead. Do not run away or decrease
	path perimeter of the floor.
	
	• Click "Start" in the capture program. From it all the
	individual is doing in front of the sensor will be captured.
	
	• Immediately ask for the individual start walking naturally in
	line marked on the floor, always on or slightly inside the circle,
	never greatly reducing the perimeter, while the plate must be rotated
	the rate sufficient to maintain the skeleton of the individual at the center of
	program screen capture. Ie accompany the individual with the sensor
	Kinect, keeping it in the center of the screen capture.
	
	• When the individual return to starting position (left side of the sensor)
	click "Pause" and then "Capture" → "Save Capture".
	
	• The program creates a directory with the individual's name, and save your
	hiking. For the individual to walk again, provide the same
	identifier (identical) and the new path number "New Capture ..."
