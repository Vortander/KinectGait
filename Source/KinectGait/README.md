## Instructions for Walk and capture

### Capture Setup using Kinect
Virginia Ortiz Andersson - September / 2014

Please have the following materials:

1. Microsoft Kinect 360.
2. Source Bivolt Adapter 110-220v Sensor Kinect For Xbox 360.
3. turntable.
4. Microcomputer and Software previously installed.
5. Power extension with at least 3 or 4 outlets.
6. Small table or class (60cm high, but can vary).
7. A tape measure or measuring tape
8. Adhesive tape for markings on the floor. (Can be tape + pieces of paper).
9. classroom or other place with enough empty space and electric lighting.

Setup Mounting
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Check the classroom or other place for the presence of obstacles (chairs, tables, etc.) and remove them to not interfere with the walk of individuals. The room must be completely empty or partially empty for capture, as shown in Figure 3.

2. Choose a wall to place the table that will support the Kinect sensor. Kinect should not face directly windows or other light sources. In places with windows, if possible, select the window wall for positioning the sensor.

3. Position the table by the wall chosen in the center of it.

4. Place the turntable (spin disk) on the same table. Choose a place to put the computer without interfering with the turntable. Remember that Kinect will be placed on top of this dish and it needs to stay with free view.

5. Prepare an extension cord, check outlets, and turn all equipment electronics used during capture. You can now connect the Kinect if you want. 

6. Position Kinect on the turntable, facing at the center of the opposite wall, with its base on or closest possible to the outer circumference dish.

7. Mark the position of the Kinect on the floor, below its initial position with the tape or tape + paper. At the end of these steps, you should present a similar setup to shown in Figure 1

Marking the limits and semicircle to walk
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 - now use the tape or tape measure to measure from the bottom marker
starting position of Kinect, with 3m radius length, for the side, diagonals and center,
forming a semicircle, as shown in Figure 2. Use paper or tape to make
markers on the ground at the end of each mark, as shown in Figure 2, obtaining the
Final installation similar to Figure 3.

Walk and capture
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 - Run the KinectGait.exe program and check the image that appears on video box. Ask for the
volunteer to stand in the first semicircle side markers. In this step, a skeleton should appear in front of the image of the person, represented its main joints. Verify that you can view the entire skeleton and all joints. If necessary, close the program and run KinectCalibration.exe to adjust the position of the Kinect sensor.

2 - With KinectGait.exe running, move the spining dish and check that are no obstacles in the sensor's field of view.

3 - See Figure 4. It shows the arrows indicating the two walking directions
an individual must perform, starting at the left side of the sensor, through the
diagonals, center, to the right side of the sensor. In this position the person should be
instructed to return, walking the same path over, ending in the initial position.
Memorize this procedure to request execution to volunteers.

4 - For each new volunteer walk, perform the following steps:

	• Ask their name or provide any unique identifier for that
	individual (as Person141). Also ask their age, height and weight and
	provide their gender (male or female). Record this information together
	with the provided unique identifier for later use.
	
	• In the "Capture" menu, click "New Capture ..." and provide the unique identifier.
	Enter the number of walk (eg, "1" if the first "2" to
	second, etc.). Ok, or enter.
	
	• Ask the person to position in the first marker in the left side of
	Kinect.
	
	• Turn the plate and hold the person and his skeleton in the center of the screen
	which appears in the capture program. If the skeleton is not showing,
	ask for the person to position himself facing the kinect, in the same
	position of up to 10 cm ahead. Do not decrease the path perimeter of the floor.
	
	• Click "Start" in the capture program. At this point, all the person performed movements
	in front of the sensor will be captured and saved.
	
	• Immediately ask for the individual start walking naturally in the
	line marked on the floor, always on or slightly inside the circle,
	never reducing the perimeter, while the plate must be rotated
	at a sufficient rate to maintain the skeleton of the individual at the center of
	program screen capture. Follow the person with the Kinect sensor
	keeping it in the center of the screen capture.
	
	• When the individual return to the starting position (left side of the sensor)
	click "Pause" and then "Capture" → "Save Capture".
	
	• The program creates a directory with the person's unique identifier provided, saving their
	performed walks on it. For the individual to walk again, provide the same
	identifier (identical) and the new path number "New Capture ..."
